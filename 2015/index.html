                        share their knowledge and experience. Two tracks, 6 sessions each.</p>

                        warm lunch (3 courses) and a guided brewery tour and beer tasting.
                        But no worries! We'll have plenty of coffee and soda, too.</p>

                        It also allows us to keep the cost low, providing a day of learning that's really worth everyone's
                        valuable time.</p>

It's not unlikely we can pick up your applications and existing infrastructure and just move it to the Azure Platform and make your IT run as it did on premise.

The fundamental characteristics of the post Cloud world are different. There are new opportunities for you to learn to utilize and love!

And yet too many applications, once deployed, remain unmonitored and thus, their developers tend to behave passive when it comes to supporting their customers. Ever heard a developer say 'I don't know why it doesn't work for you. It works perfectly fine on my PC.'? During this session I'll walk you through the best practices of both implementing and using Azure Application Insights so that you will be two steps ahead of your customer and eventually get to be pro-active when it comes to supporting applications deployed in the wild."><strong>Know your customers, know your apps!</strong></a><br/>
